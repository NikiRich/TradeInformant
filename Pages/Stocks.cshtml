                <h6>SMA - Simple Movement Average</h6>

                <p>
                    SMA is an average of a stock's closing prices over a specified period of time.
                </p>

                <h6>How is it calculated?</h6>

                <p>
                    It's simply the sum of the closing prices over the number of Periods dived by
                    that number of Periods.

                <h6>EMA - Exponential Movement Average</h6>

                <p>
                    Same as SMA but EMA puts more weight on recent prices and thus making it more
                    responsive to recent price changes.
                </p>

                <h6>How is it calculated?</h6>

                <p>
                    It's a weighted averege that factors in the most recent price changes compared

                <h6>MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence</h6>

                <p>
                    MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two EMAs of a security’s price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>MACD Line</strong><br />
                    Positive MACD Value: Indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting upward price momentum and a potential bullish trend.<br />
                    Negative MACD Value: Implies that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, pointing to downward price momentum and a potential bearish trend.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Signal Line</strong><br />
                    Positive Signal Line: When the signal line is positive, it often confirms bullish momentum if the MACD line is also positive and above the signal line.<br />
                    Negative Signal Line: A negative signal line can confirm bearish momentum if the MACD line is negative and below the signal line.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Histogram</strong><br />
                    Positive Histogram Value: Indicates that the MACD line is above the signal line, which often points to bullish momentum increasing since the MACD line is moving further away from the signal line.<br />
                    Negative Histogram Value: Suggests that the MACD line is below the signal line, often pointing to increasing bearish momentum since the MACD line is diverging further below the signal line.<br />
                </p>
                <h6>How is it calculated?</h6>

                <p>
                    It's typically calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. This results in the MACD line.
                    A 9-day EMA of the MACD is called the "signal line".

                        Oversold when it's below 30:
                    </strong> This suggests that the asset might be undervalued and could be due for a bounce or an upward correction. Traders might take this as a signal to buy the asset.

                    <strong>
                        Neutral between 30 and 70:
                    </strong> The asset is considered to be in a normal range, and it's not giving any specific buy or sell signals based purely on the RSI.

                <h6>How is it calculated?</h6>
